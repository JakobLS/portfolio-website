              <p>I'm an Engineer and Data Scientist with a touch of Web Development running in my veins.

              <p>The purpose of this website is twofold; <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/before.html" target="_blank" alt="Before the Startup">learning</a> the skills needed to create and connect an AI model (Data Science) with a user interface (Web Development), as well as showcasing some of the projects I've worked on so far.

            <h2><a href="https://github.com/JakobLS/CancerSEEK" style="color:#98BBA5" target="_blank">CancerSEEK - Cancer Detection Through Multi-Analyte Blood Test</a></h2>

            <p><a href="https://thrivedetect.com/" target="_blank">Thrive Earlier Detection</a> launched early 2019 following a $110 Million Series A financing. Learning about the company and the research caught my interest. After reading their publications I thought I would have a fair chance of improving their cancer detection model on the published proteomics and genomics data.</p>

            <p>Maintaining specificity at >99% I managed to improve sensitivity for Breast, Colorectal and Pancreas cancers by 100%, 31% and 21%, respectively. These three cancer types stand for more than 4 million new cases annually.</p>

            <p>Although one of my initial goals with the project was to attempt a collaboration with the company upon completion, they had moved their focus to other approaches they deemed more promising for improving sensitivity. Nevertheless, I gained deep understanding of the entire Machine Learning workflow as well as insights into product/market fit as a result of the project.</p>

            <p>Complementary on above with the purpose of improving specificity by evaluating abnormal number of chromosomes in the blood. Specificity was indeed improved to 99.8%, slightly higher than before.</p>

            <p>The project gave me further extensive knowledge in the entire EDA process, among those data transformation and feature engineering, as well as model stacking, model tuning and unbiased model evaluation.</p>

            <p>Analysed light emitted from distant stars using Deep Learning techniques where all pre-processing and model architecture steps were developed by me. The data was transformed into spectra and fed into Convolutionl Neural Networks to predict three target variables; temperature, gravity and metallicity.</p>

            <p>The long-term goal of the project was to find habitable exoplanets and this new method decreased the error on earlier Machine Learning approaches by more than 35 times. Consequently, I developed an extensive understanding of the entire computer vision workflow.</p>

            <p>As my graduation from Engineering was approaching, the core motivation for this project was to create an automated stock-trading system for the Stockholm Stock Exchange to help pay back the loans I had so willingly accumulated during my time at University.</p> 

            <p>Although it turned out to be a more difficult task than anticipated I learned a great deal about applying deep learning techniques on time series data.</p>
