            <h2>Predicting Tyre Tread Depth on a Small Dataset using Deep Learning</a></h2>

            <p><i>2021</i></p>

            <p>Maintaining proper wheel quality is incredibly important for good road safety. For organisations owning larger fleets of vehicles, taking them off the road for maintenance can be costly. Being able to better plan when maintenence is needed, and on what parts of the vehicle through smarter logging can significantly reduce business expenses.</p>

            <p>In this project we collected images of tyres (315 in total) to test the hypothesis on whether it's possible to predict the tyre tread depth on single camera input images using deep learning techniques. Despite the small dataset, we chose a design that can easily be scaled up to millions of samples with virtual no changes to the code.</p>

            <p>Although the dataset is very small, this early-stage experiment seem to indicate that it <i>is</i> possible to predict the tread depth of tyres using deep learning techniques. More data should however be collected to verify the results with greater confidence.</p>

            <h2><a href="Skin_cancer_detection.html" style="color:#98BBA5">Detecting Melanoma Skin Cancer with Computer Vision</a></h2>

            <p><i>2021</i></p>

            <p>There were around 300,000 newly diagnosed <i>melanoma</i> and one million <i>non-melanoma</i> skin cancer cases worldwide in 2018. The numbers are estimated to increase in the coming years. My home country Sweden, is ranked 6th in terms of cancer rates per capita, averaged over both sexes.</p>

            <p>The ability to quickly and accurately check a spot on the skin has the potential to benefit millions of people. Using deep learning, I tested the hypothesis on whether it's possible to distinguish melanoma from non-melanoma skin cancer. Due to hardware restrictions, a small dataset was chosen (3,297 images), but the current design will be able to process larger datasets with only minor changes to the code.</p>

            <p>I successfully showed that it <i>is</i> possible to differentiate melanoma from non-melanoma skin cancer. With the current dataset, a smaller model performs just as well as a larger one, and should thus be preferred. However, if more data can be collected, the larger model will likely perform significantly better.</p>

            <p><a href="https://thrivedetect.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thrive Earlier Detection</a> launched in early 2019 with $110M of Series A funding. The project piqued my interest; I thought I could provide an improved cancer detection model with their published proteomics and genomics data.</p>

            <p>I succeeded: my model improved sensitivity for breast, colorectal and pancreas cancers by 100%, 31% and 21%, respectively, while maintaining specificity at >99%.  These three cancer types account for more than four million new cases annually.</p>

            <p>I gained deeper understanding of the entire Machine Learning workflow as well as insights into product/market fit as a result of the project.</p>

            <p>Although it wasn't a result of my work, the company was later acquired for above $2 billion.</p>

            <p><i>2020</i></p>

            <p>This work was similar to the multi-analyte blood test project, but focused on improving specificity by evaluating abnormal blood chromosome counts. Specificity was indeed improved to 99.8%, slightly higher than before.</p>

            <p>The project gave me extensive knowledge of the entire EDA process on structured data, including data transformation and feature engineering, model stacking, model tuning and unbiased model evaluation.</p>

            <p><i>2018</i></p>

            <p>I developed a complete pre-processing pipeline and a model architecture in order to apply deep learning to analyze light emitted from distant stars. The data was transformed into large spectra (i.e. images) and fed into convolutional neural networks to predict three target variables: temperature, gravity and metallicity. Total size of the dataset was close to 100GB after pre-processing.</p>

            <p>The long-term goal of this project is to find habitable exoplanets and this new method decreased the error on earlier machine learning approaches by more than thirty-five times. Note that this research is only one out of many steps to find habitable exoplanets.</p>

            <p>My motives for this project were more selfish; I hoped that an automated stock-trading system for the Stockholm Stock Exchange might help me pay off student loans.</p> 

            <p>The project was tougher than expected.  Still, I learned a lot about the application of deep learning to time series data, as well as real-time data collection techniques.</p>
