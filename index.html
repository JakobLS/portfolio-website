            <p><i>2023</i></p>

            <p>There’s been a lot of buzz around Natural Language Processing, or NLP, the last few years after important technological advances that has allowed more performant models even in situations with limited access to data. This literally exploded in November 2022 when OpenAI’s ChatGPT was launched. As a result, I‘d like to take the opportunity to show how you can fine-tune a pre-trained model on a task of your choice on your own.</p>

            <p>Additionally, I will leverage both structured and unstructured data by processing both of it in the same model architecture. This can yield important performance improvements on some tasks.</p>

            <p><i>2022</i></p>

            <p>Let's learn more about what makes a song popular on Spotify. My intuition is that shorter, vocal and more energetic songs are more popular among the general population. These are the kind of songs you hear most frequently when tuning into the radio or checking the top tracks of the month.</p>

            <p>Is it possible to prove this statistically? Moreover, is your music taste more in line with the general public's, or you've developed a unique taste of your own?</p>

            <p><i>2022</i></p>

            <p>Is it feasible to train a model on 100 million ratings using nothing more than a common laptop? Let's find out.</p>

            <p>I've been refreshing Spark lately and wanted to give it a try on a dataset I wouldn't be able to deal with using, otherwise common data scientist tools, such as Pandas and Numpy. I came across the dataset and the Netflix challenge it originates from some time ago, but never really had any reason to work on it. Until now.</p>

            <p>This mini project shows that it's possible to work with such large datasets on your standard equipment at home without having to use cloud services. The final model was trained in less time than what it takes to join an outdoor exercise session.</p>

            <p>I should mention that you can speed things up <i>significantly</i> using the cloud though.</p>

            <p><i>2021</i></p>

            <p>Maintaining proper wheel quality is incredibly important for good road safety. For organisations owning larger fleets of vehicles, taking them off the road for maintenance can be costly. Being able to better plan when maintenance is needed, and on what parts of the vehicle through smarter predictions can significantly reduce expenses.</p>

            <p>In this project we collected images of tyres (~300 in total) to test the hypothesis on whether it's possible to predict the tyre tread depth on single camera input images using deep learning techniques. Despite the small dataset, we chose a design that can easily be scaled up to millions of samples with virtually no changes to the code.</p>

            <p>Although the dataset is very small, this early-stage experiment seems to indicate that it <i>is</i> possible to predict the tread depth of tyres using deep learning techniques. More data should however be collected to verify the results with greater confidence. Another, plausible more important aspect, is whether it's easier to take a photo of sufficient quality of a tyre rather than just using current methods.</p>

            <p>There were around 300k newly diagnosed <i>melanoma</i> and one million <i>non-melanoma</i> skin cancer cases worldwide in 2018. The numbers are estimated to increase in the coming years. My home country Sweden, is ranked 6th in terms of cancer rates per capita, averaged over all sexes. The ability to quickly and accurately check a spot on the skin has the potential to benefit millions of people.</p>

            <p>We will test the idea whether it's possible to distinguish melanoma from non-melanoma skin cancer using deep learning techniques. To save on computational costs, a small dataset is chosen (~3k images), but the current design will be able to process larger datasets with only minor changes to the code.</p>

            <p>This work was similar to the multi-analyte blood test project, but focused on improving sensitivity by evaluating abnormalities in the blood. Sensitivity was indeed improved to 98.1%, significantly higher than before, while maintaining specificity at 99%.</p>

            <p>It turns out that by simply using a more performant, but very common, algorithm the results were improved by a large margin. The original research team must simply not have considered it for their publication.</p>

            <p>I developed a complete pre-processing pipeline and a model architecture in order to apply deep learning to analyze light emitted from distant stars. The data was transformed into large spectra (i.e. images) and fed into convolutional neural networks to predict three target variables: temperature, gravity and metallicity. Total size of the dataset was close to 100GB after pre-processing.</p>

            <p>The long-term goal of this project is to find habitable exoplanets and this new method decreased the error on earlier machine learning approaches by more than thirty-five times.</p>
