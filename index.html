            <p><i>2021 - present</i></p>

            <p>EvaluateML is building a machine learning system to automatically evaluate open-ended questions in schools.</p>

            <p>Multiple choice questions are a frequent option as they can be evaluated in an instant, saving precious educator time. However, they are a poor proxy for how things work in real life, and choosing them over open-ended alternatives leads to students not developing their creativity and critical thinking as well as one would like - seriously hurting both them and society at large.</p>

            <p>We believe it's better to learn <i>how</i> to think rather than <i>what</i> to think, and if we can improve the learning output from our education system by only a small fraction, the implications that will have on our society would be staggering.</p>

            <p>Is it feasable to train a model on 100 million ratings using nothing more than a common laptop? Let's find out.</p>

            <p>I've been refreshing Spark lately and wanted to give it a try on a dataset I wouldn't be able to deal with using, otherwise common data scientist tools, such as Pandas and Numpy. I came across the dataset and the Netflix challenge it originates from some time ago, but never really had any reason to work on it. Until now.</p>

            <p>This mini project shows that it's totally possible to work with such large datasets on your standard equipment at home without having to use cloud services. The final model was trained in a little less than 1.5 hour, which perfectly fits within the time it takes to join an outdoor exercise session.</p>

            <p><i>2021</i></p>

            <p>Maintaining proper wheel quality is incredibly important for good road safety. For organisations owning larger fleets of vehicles, taking them off the road for maintenance can be costly. Being able to better plan when maintenence is needed, and on what parts of the vehicle through smarter predictions can significantly reduce expenses.</p>

            <p>In this project we collected images of tyres (~300 in total) to test the hypothesis on whether it's possible to predict the tyre tread depth on single camera input images using deep learning techniques. Despite the small dataset, we chose a design that can easily be scaled up to millions of samples with virtually no changes to the code.</p>

            <p>Although the dataset is very small, this early-stage experiment seems to indicate that it <i>is</i> possible to predict the tread depth of tyres using deep learning techniques. More data should however be collected to verify the results with greater confidence. Another, plausible more important aspect, is whether it's easier to take a photo of sufficient quality of a tyre rather than just using current methods.</p>

            <p><i>2021</i></p>

            <p>There were around 300,000 newly diagnosed <i>melanoma</i> and one million <i>non-melanoma</i> skin cancer cases worldwide in 2018. The numbers are estimated to increase in the coming years. My home country Sweden, is ranked 6th in terms of cancer rates per capita, averaged over both sexes.</p>

            <p>The ability to quickly and accurately check a spot on the skin has the potential to benefit millions of people. Using deep learning, I tested the hypothesis on whether it's possible to distinguish melanoma from non-melanoma skin cancer. Due to hardware restrictions, a small dataset was chosen (3,297 images), but the current design will be able to process larger datasets with only minor changes to the code.</p>

            <p>I successfully showed that it <i>is</i> possible to differentiate melanoma from non-melanoma skin cancer. With the current dataset, a smaller model performs just as well as a larger one, and should thus be preferred. However, if more data can be collected, the larger model will likely perform significantly better.</p>

The project piqued my interest as I thought I could provide an improved cancer detection model with their published proteomics and genomics data.</p>

            <p>My model improved sensitivity for breast, colorectal and pancreas cancers by 100%, 31% and 21%, respectively, while maintaining specificity at >99%.  These three cancer types account for more than four million new cases annually.</p>

            <p>I gained deeper understanding of the entire Machine Learning workflow as well as insights into product/market fit as a result of the project.</p>

            <p>Although it wasn't a direct result of my work, the company was later acquired for north of $2 billion.</p>

            <p>This work was similar to the multi-analyte blood test project, but focused on improving specificity by evaluating abnormal blood chromosome counts. Specificity was indeed improved to 99.8%, slightly higher than before, while maintaining sensitivty.</p>

            <p><i>2018</i></p>

            <p>I developed a complete pre-processing pipeline and a model architecture in order to apply deep learning to analyze light emitted from distant stars. The data was transformed into large spectra (i.e. images) and fed into convolutional neural networks to predict three target variables: temperature, gravity and metallicity. Total size of the dataset was close to 100GB after pre-processing.</p>

            <p>The long-term goal of this project is to find habitable exoplanets and this new method decreased the error on earlier machine learning approaches by more than thirty-five times.</p>
