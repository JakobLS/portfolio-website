              <p>I'm an engineer and data scientist with a bit of a taste for web development. Originally from Sweden, currently residing in Madrid while building on my next <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/notnot.html" target="_blank" alt="Why to not not start a startup">venture</a>, which will require <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/before.html" target="_blank" alt="Before the Startup">knowledge</a> aquired in all three of these fields.</p>

              <p>The purpose of this website is twofold: to create and connect an AI model (Data Science) with a user interface (Web Development), and to offer a showcase for some of the projects I've worked on so far. Take a scroll!</p>

            <h2><a href="https://github.com/JakobLS/CancerSEEK" style="color:#98BBA5" target="_blank">Cancer Detection Through Multi-Analyte Blood Test</a></h2>

            <p><a href="https://thrivedetect.com/" target="_blank">Thrive Earlier Detection</a> launched in early 2019 with $110M of Series A financing. The project piqued my interest; I thought I could provide an improved cancer detection model with their published proteomics and genomics data.</p>

            <p>I succeeded: my model improved sensitivity for breast, colorectal and pancreas cancers by 100%, 31% and 21%, respectively, while maintaining specificity at >99%.  These three cancer types account for more than four million new cases annually.</p>

            <p>I gained deeper understanding of the entire Machine Learning workflow as well as insights into product/market fit as a result of the project.</p>

            <h2><a href="https://github.com/JakobLS/CancerSEEK-Folllow-up" style="color:#98BBA5" target="_blank">Assessing Abnormal Chromosomes using Machine Learning</a></h2>

            <p>This work was similar to the multi-analyte blood test project, but focused on improving specificity by evaluating abnormal blood chromosome counts. Specificity was indeed improved to 99.8%, slightly higher than before.</p>

            <p>The project gave me extensive knowledge of the entire EDA process, including data transformation and feature engineering, as well as model stacking, model tuning and unbiased model evaluation.</p>

            <h2><a href="https://github.com/JakobLS/Exoplanets-DeepLearning" style="color:#98BBA5" target="_blank">Finding Habitable Exoplanets with Deep Learning</a></h2>

            <p>I developed a complete pre-processing pipeline and model architecture in order to apply deep learning to analyze light emitted from distant stars. The data was transformed into spectra and fed into convolutional neural networks to predict three target variables: temperature, gravity and metallicity.</p>

            <p>The long-term goal of this project was to find habitable exoplanets and this new method decreased the error on earlier machine learning approaches by more than thirty-five times. As a result, I developed a solid understanding of the computer vision workflow.</p>

            <p>My motives for this project were more selfish; I hoped that an automated stock-trading system for the Stockholm Stock Exchange might help me pay off student loans.</p> 

            <p>The project was tougher than expected.  Still, I learned a lot about the application of deep learning to time series data, as well as real-time data collection techniques.</p>
